  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p>I am currently a Class 9 student studying at <u><b>C.P.S (Crescent Public School)</b></u>  . Being in Class 9 is a significant phase of my educational journey, where I am diving deeper into complex subjects and developing a strong academic foundation. At this stage, I am not just focusing on school curriculum but also exploring areas that interest me, such as programming, design, and video editing. My school has been instrumental in shaping my personality and preparing me for future challenges.Education for me is not just about grades but about acquiring knowledge and applying it to real-world problems. I believe that the right education empowers individuals to think critically, innovate, and contribute positively to society.</p>

  <h1>Skills</h1>
  <p>I have developed a range of skills that showcase my creative and technical abilities. Here are the key skills I have honed:
</p>
<h2>Graphic Designing (3 Months of Experience):</h2>
<p>As <u><b>a graphic designer,</b></u>  I have explored the art of visual storytelling. My experience of three months has taught me to use tools and software to create aesthetically pleasing and impactful designs. From logos to posters, I have learned to combine creativity with functionality to deliver meaningful designs.</p>
<h2>Documentary Video Editing (5 Months of Experience):</h2>
<p><u><b>Editing documentaries</b></u> has been one of the most rewarding experiences for me. With five months of hands-on experience, I have learned how to craft stories through visuals, music, and transitions. This skill requires precision, a good sense of storytelling, and the ability to convey emotions effectively. My work reflects my passion for creating videos that leave a lasting impact.</p>
<h2>Programming (Java, Python, HTML):</h2>
<p><u><b>My programming skills</b></u> in Java, Python, and HTML highlight my technical proficiency and problem-solving capabilities. Java and Python have introduced me to the world of application development and automation, while HTML has provided me with the foundation for web development. These skills represent my interest in technology and my goal to create innovative solutions in the future.

<h1>My Favourite Subjects</h1>
<p>I have always been drawn to subjects that challenge my mind and allow me to explore the mysteries of the world. My favorite subjects are:</p>
<h2>Physics:</h2>
<p>Physics fascinates me because it explains the fundamental principles that govern our universe. From understanding the laws of motion to the wonders of quantum mechanics, studying physics fuels my curiosity about how the world operates. It also nurtures my problem-solving skills and critical thinking.</p>
<h2>Chemistry:</h2>
<p>Chemistry bridges the gap between physics and biology, offering insights into the composition of matter and its interactions. I enjoy learning about chemical reactions, the periodic table, and how substances transform, making it a captivating subject for me.
</p>
<h2>Mathematics:</h2>
<p>Mathematics is the language of logic and precision. It challenges me to think systematically and solve complex problems. Whether it’s algebra, geometry, or calculus, I find joy in unraveling mathematical puzzles. Mathematics is not just a subject for me but a tool that shapes my thinking and sharpens my analytical abilities.


These subjects collectively inspire me to pursue a career in STEM, where I can combine my love for science and problem-solving to make a difference.
